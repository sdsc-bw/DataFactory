# Fine-tuning
## What is Fine-tuning

When developing a model, we use different models with different hyperparameters, like the maximal depth of a decision tree or the numbers of trees in a random forest. To get a good model, we use fine-tuning to find the best model and according to that the best hyperparameters of a model for a given problem.

## Proposed methods
There is a variety of fine-tuning frameworks and we want to present the most common methods in this Demo.
