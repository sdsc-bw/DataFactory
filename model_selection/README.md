# Model Selection
## What is model selection
There is a variety of models that can be used in machine learning like decision trees, random forests, neural networks...
According to the problem, some models fit better than others. For example, for a simple problem it makes sense to use a more simple model like a decision tree, because more complex models like neural networks can lead to overfitting. Whereas these complexe models perform better at non-linear problems.

In this repo we want to present commonly used machine learning models.

## Models
### Decision tree
A decision tree is the most simple model. 
### Random forest
### Neural network
